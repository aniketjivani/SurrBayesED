(Under construction)

Multiple stages of experimental design, depending on the objective. Assume access to high-fidelity model runs and surrogate model trained on these runs. Then:

1. Stage 0: Infer surrogate model parameters

2. Stage 1: Goal-oriented - improve surrogate predictions

3. Stage 2: Infer HF model parameters

Examples?:

1. Falling ball (Mechanics)
