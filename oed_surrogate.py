# %% Implement OED for surrogate model trained from a high-fidelity model. The objectives are to select training points for the surrogate model based on:
# 1. Information gain in the surrogate model parameters
# 2. Information gain in the surrogate model predictions!

# Code adapted from OED code written by Wanggang Shen: https://github.com/wgshen/OED/blob/main/oed/oed.py
